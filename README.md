# 2DGameEngine
A 2D engine created using Monogame/Microsoft XNA framework.

Currently a work in progress.
Basic physics, movement and animations have been put in, but still need refining.
Level saving and creating is working (you can write and read levels using JSON).
Basic editor UI is functional (you can add the two sprites I have made with a right click option).

Currently I am working on the UI to make level editing easy.
After this I plan to make the physics (particularly collisions) better.
I've also got sidescrolling working, but intend to give this a revamp.

Once this is all done, it'll be time to make some games!
